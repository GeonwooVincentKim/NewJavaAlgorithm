# Regular_Expression

Getting start with `Regular-Expression` when you use `Java`, `Python`, `C++`, `C#`, or other languages.

## How to use Regular-Expression

### Basic Character when you trying to use `Regular-Expression`

- `.` -> `One` Character
- `?` -> `No` Charcter or only `one` Character
- `+` -> More than `one` Character
- `*` -> More than `0` character
- `^` -> Start `Character-Sequence(String)`
- `[]` -> `Select one` Character
- `[^]` -> Exclude `[]` Character
- `|` -> `or`
- `&` -> `and`
- `()` -> `Grouping`
- `\s` -> `One Blank`
- `\S` -> Character which is `not blank`
- `\d` -> `Number`
- `\D` -> Character which is `not number`
- `\w` -> Character which is `not Special-Symbols`
- `\W` -> `Special-Symbols`
- `{n}` -> `n` Characters
- `{n,}` -> Characters more than `n`
- `{n,m}` -> Characters from `n` to `m`

### Basic `Regular-Expression` pattern

- `[a-z]?` -> `One LowerCase` Character
- `[0-9]+` -> More than `one LowerCase` Character
- `0[1-9]*` -> The `Number` starting from `0`
- `^[0-9]` -> Starting from `Number`
- `[^0-9]` -> Character which is `not number`
- `[a-z*]` -> `LowerCase Character` more than `0`
